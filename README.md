# Chatbot_Using_Agentic_RAG_System

This project is structured as an **Agentic RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** system built using **LangGraph** and deployed via a **Streamlit** front-end. It demonstrates an advanced RAG pipeline where a ReAct agent is used to intelligently decide between searching a user-provided document corpus or using general knowledge tools.

The primary goal is to answer a user's question by either retrieving information from a set of ingested documents (RAG) or, if needed, searching Wikipedia for external knowledge. This decision and the final answer generation are handled by a ReAct Agent within the LangGraph framework.
